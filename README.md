## üìå Project Overview  
This project presents a **two-stage spam detection framework** for reviews of the TikTok application on the Google Play Store.  
The research was published in **IEEE IAICT 2025**, co-authored as part of an academic collaboration.  

The framework works in two steps:  
1. **Stage 1:** Classify reviews into **Spam** vs **Non-Spam**.  
2. **Stage 2:** Further classify spam reviews into **Sensitive Spam** vs **Insensitive Spam**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Gensim  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset  
- Reviews collected from **Google Play Store (TikTok app)**.  
- Preprocessing steps included:  
  - Text cleansing  
  - Tokenization  
  - Stopword removal  
  - Vectorization using **TF-IDF** and **Word2Vec**

## üî¨ Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing** ‚Üí Cleansing, tokenization, stopword removal, feature extraction.  
2. **Stage 1 Classification** ‚Üí Trained ML/DL models to classify **Spam vs Non-Spam**.  
3. **Stage 2 Classification** ‚Üí For detected spam, trained additional models to classify **Sensitive vs Insensitive Spam**.  
4. **Models Implemented:**  
   - Machine Learning: Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression  
   - Deep Learning: CNN, LSTM, MLP  

---

## üìä Results  
- The **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)** with **TF-IDF features** achieved the highest performance.  
- Final accuracy: **96%**.  
- Results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining traditional ML with deep learning for spam detection.
